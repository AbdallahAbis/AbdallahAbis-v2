As a dedicated Gatsby and JamStack developer, my expertise extends to building and maintaining state-of-the-art websites using various Headless CMS platforms. My web development journey began as an Affiliate/CPA marketer, leading me to acquire deep skills in technologies like React.js, Gatsby.js, and Next.js. Currently, I am on my way to mastering Cloudflare, including its workers, queues, and other advanced features, to further enhance my ability to create robust, high-performance websites. Specializing in Gatsby, I have a rich portfolio of diverse projects ranging from eCommerce sites to blogs and SaaS platforms. Known for crafting fast, SEO-optimized websites leveraging Gatsby's unique optimizations and extensive plugin library, I am committed to delivering top-tier results that are perfectly tailored to meet your business objectives.
