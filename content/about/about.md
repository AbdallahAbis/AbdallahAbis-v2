I’m a 20 years old freelancer who’s based in Agadir, Morocco. <br /> I
design and develop websites and web applications, I haven’t had the
chance to work in a company yet, but I’ve been freelancing and
networking with other developers for enough time to be a good designer
and developer.
<br /> “Less Is More”, I love dark and minimalist design, That’s why I
try to make all of my projects simple and stunning. When it comes to
code, I always write clean and understandable code, with as much
documentation as possible.
