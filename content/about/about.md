A JAM Stack web developer who specializes in JavaScript Technologies, Experience in building complete websites with Backend using CMS.<br />
I have been freelancing and networking with other developers for enough time to be a good designer and developer, in less than 1 year as a freelancer I have worked for +10 clients and worked on +15 projects.<br />
“Less Is More”, Writing less code leads to clean, functional software that’s easy to maintain over time, I always try to follow this concept and write as little code as possible.
"Simplicity is Key", Minimalist design lets the content stand out and shine. This is why a simple website design is the first choice I think of when it comes to designing.
